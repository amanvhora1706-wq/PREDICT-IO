# Predict IO – Financial Data Visualization & Forecasting Web Application   

## Overview
Predict IO is a web-based financial analytics application built to collect, visualize, and analyze live market data in an intuitive and meaningful way. The project focuses on helping users better understand financial patterns by transforming raw market data into interactive visualizations and simple trend forecasts.

The application pulls real-time data from stock, currency, and fuel markets using public financial APIs and applies Moving Average–based forecasting to highlight short-term trends. Interactive dashboards make it easy to explore data and gain insights without requiring advanced financial knowledge.

## Key Objectives
- Collect real-time financial data from reliable public APIs  
- Visualize market trends through interactive dashboards  
- Apply basic time-series forecasting using Moving Average techniques  
- Present complex financial information in a clear and user-friendly format  

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Data Visualization:** Plotly.js  
- **APIs:** Alpha Vantage  
- **Forecasting Technique:** Moving Average  

## Project Scope
The application currently supports:
- Stock market data visualization  
- Currency (forex) data analysis  
- Fuel price trend tracking  
- Simple trend prediction using historical data  

The focus of the project is on **clarity, usability, and interpretability** rather than high-frequency trading or complex financial modeling.

## My Role
This project was developed as part of an industry internship at **Tech Elecon Pvt. Ltd. (Jan 2025 – Apr 2025)**.  
I was responsible for the complete development lifecycle, including:
- Designing the application structure and data flow  
- Integrating financial APIs and preprocessing data  
- Implementing Moving Average–based forecasting logic  
- Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations  
- Testing and refining the user experience  

## Results & Learnings
- Successfully integrated live financial data into a web application  
- Built interactive dashboards that simplify complex datasets  
- Gained hands-on experience with time-series data and forecasting concepts  
- Improved understanding of financial analytics and real-world data challenges  

## Limitations
Uses a basic Moving Average method and does not include advanced forecasting models.

Prediction accuracy depends on the quality and availability of external API data.

Some data sources (fuel prices and news) are shown using sample data due to free API limitations.

Focuses on short-term trend indication rather than long-term market forecasting.

Does not consider external factors such as economic events or company fundamentals.

Intended for learning and analysis purposes, not for real-time trading or financial decisions.
