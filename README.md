# Predict IO – Financial Data Visualization & Forecasting Web Application   

## Overview
Predict IO is an online finance prediction solution designed for collecting, visualising, and analysing real-time financial data. Through Predicting IO, users can learn about financial trends in real-time, view raw finance data in visual format (graphs and charts), and create easy-to-understand predictions about current and future trends in finances.

The financial markets (stocks, currency, and fuel) are updated in real-time by using financial web API's. Moving Averages are used to identify short-term trends, while Predicting IO facilitates easy interaction with these data through dynamic dashboards.

## Key Objectives
- Collect real-time financial data using publicly available APIs.  
- Visualise financial data through interactive dashboards.
- Forecast basic time series data using Moving Averages.
- Present complex financial data in a format that the average individual can understand.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Data Visualization:** Plotly.js  
- **APIs:** Alpha Vantage  
- **Forecasting Technique:** Moving Average  

## Project Scope
The application currently supports:
- Stock market data visualization  
- Currency (forex) data analysis  
- Fuel price trend tracking  
- Simple trend prediction using historical data  

The project focuses on producing results in as clear, user-friendly, and interpretable way as possible and will not be focused on fast-paced trading or advanced financial modelling.
## My Role
As part of my internship at Tech Elecon Pvt Ltd (Jan 2025 – Apr 2025), I led the development cycle of this project, which encompasses all phases from start to finish. When developing this application, I was also responsible for doing the following:

- Designing how all the "systems/data" interact within the web application, and also creating the "workflow" for how a user would process and work with their financial data.
- Integrating financial web APIs to receive the financial data and pre-processing the received data.
- Creating and Implementing the logic for forecasting using Moving Average's. 
- Creating dashboards and Visualizations that are user-friendly and allows for easy navigation.
-  Performing Testing/Refinement to improve the User Experience.

## Results & Learnings
- I Successfully Integrated the Financial Data into a Live Financial Application.
- I Designed and Developed Dashboards that are Interactive and allow for quick/easy searching through multiple Complex Data Sets.
- I gained hands-on experience working with Time Series Data and Forecasting Concepts.
- I have a Much Better Understanding of Financial Analytics and Challenges Involved with Real-World Data.  

## Limitations
- Usage of Moving Average method is Very Basic and Doesn’t Incorporate more advanced Forecasting Models.
- The Prediction also depends on the Quality of Data from External APIs and the availability of that data.
- No Free API's that provide Historical data to take data and project future predictions exist for the two Data Sources (Fuel Prices and News) shown above, hence the use of Sample Data.
- The Focus of this project is on Short-Term Trend Indicators and Not Long-Term Market Forecasting.
- I have not taken into consideration any Other Factors Outside of this project, such as Economic events (i.e. Oil Prices, Inflation, Interest Rates, etc.) and Company Fundamentals.
- Intended for the Purpose of Learning/Analysis only, Not to be used for actual Financial Decisions or Live-Trading.
