# Predict IO – Financial Data Visualization & Forecasting Web Application   

## Overview
Predict IO is an online finance prediction solution designed for collecting, visualising, and analysing real-time financial data. Through Predicting IO, users can learn about financial trends in real-time, view raw finance data in visual format (graphs and charts), and create easy-to-understand predictions about current and future trends in finances.

The financial markets (stocks, currency, and fuel) are updated in real-time by using financial web API's. Moving Averages are used to identify short-term trends, while Predicting IO facilitates easy interaction with these data through dynamic dashboards.

## Key Objectives
- Collect real-time financial data using publicly available APIs.  
- Visualise financial data through interactive dashboards.
- Forecast basic time series data using Moving Averages.
- Present complex financial data in a format that the average individual can understand.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Data Visualization:** Plotly.js  
- **APIs:** Alpha Vantage  
- **Forecasting Technique:** Moving Average  

## Project Scope
The application currently supports:
- Stock market data visualization  
- Currency (forex) data analysis  
- Fuel price trend tracking  
- Simple trend prediction using historical data  

The project focuses on producing results in as clear, user-friendly, and interpretable way as possible and will not be focused on fast-paced trading or advanced financial modelling.
## My Role
This project was developed as part of an industry internship at **Tech Elecon Pvt. Ltd. (Jan 2025 – Apr 2025)**.  
I was responsible for the complete development lifecycle, including:
- Designing the application structure and data flow  
- Integrating financial APIs and preprocessing data  
- Implementing Moving Average–based forecasting logic  
- Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations  
- Testing and refining the user experience  

## Results & Learnings
- Successfully integrated live financial data into a web application  
- Built interactive dashboards that simplify complex datasets  
- Gained hands-on experience with time-series data and forecasting concepts  
- Improved understanding of financial analytics and real-world data challenges  

## Limitations
- Uses a basic Moving Average method and does not include advanced forecasting models.
- Prediction accuracy depends on the quality and availability of external API data.
- Some data sources (fuel prices and news) are shown using sample data due to free API limitations.
- Focuses on short-term trend indication rather than long-term market forecasting.
- Does not consider external factors such as economic events or company fundamentals.
- Intended for learning and analysis purposes, not for real-time trading or financial decisions.
